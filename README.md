# STAT841-Classification

Classification, also known aspattern recognitionis the problemof predicting a discrete random variableYfrom another random variableX. The randomvariableXmay take many different forms from Digital image libraries and text corpora togene expression microarrays and financial time series.

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the problem of classification and pat-tern recognition and reflects recent developments in the filed.
